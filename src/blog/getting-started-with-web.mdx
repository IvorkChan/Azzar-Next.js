# Getting Started with Web

Find on [GitHub](https://github.com/IvorkChan/Azzar-Next.js).

## About

This website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with a focus on simplicity.

I've once tried [Cargo](https://cargo.site/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). After comparing many frameworks, I decided to build from scratch.

## Design

### 1. Sitemap

I completed the draft in Notability.

### 2. Styling

> If you're comfortable with React, you should begin by drawing Lo-Fi and adjusting it. There are numerous Pattern Libraries available for reference.

I just set the global font, color, header and footer in this step.

One challenge is the navigation between pages. Another one is responsive design. I've only made simple adjustments for screen width so far.

### 3. Posts

To preserve Markdown compatibility, I merely added basic metadata at the beginning without inserting React components.
