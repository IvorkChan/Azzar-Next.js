# Getting Started with Web

Find this site on [GitHub](https://github.com/IvorkChan/Azzar-Next.js).

## About

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with a focus on simplicity.

## Design

### 1. Sitemap

I completed the draft in Notability.

### 2. Styling

If you're comfortable with React, you should begin by drawing Lo-Fi and adjusting it.

The quickest way of building an app is using Pattern Libraries. There are numerous ones available for reference such as Ant Design. This time I want to build from scratch.

I just set the global font, color, header and footer in this step.

One challenge is the navigation between pages. Another one is responsive design. I've only made simple adjustments for screen width so far.

### 3. Posts

To preserve Markdown compatibility, I merely added basic metadata at the beginning without inserting React components.

### 4. Syntax Highlighting

I chose `Prism.js`. And for this project, I use the plugin `remark-prism`.

Example:

```js
export async function getListData(id) {
	const listPath = path.join(listDir, `${id}.mdx`);
	const listContent = fs.readFileSync(listPath, 'utf8');
	const listMatter = matter(listContent);
	const listHtmlRaw = await remark()
		.use(html, { sanitize: false })
		.use(remarkPrism, { plugins: ['line-numbers'] })
		.process(listMatter.content);
	const listHtml = listHtmlRaw.toString();
	return {
		id,
		...listMatter.data,
		listHtml,
	};
}
```
