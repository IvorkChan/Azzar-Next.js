# Getting Started with Web

This website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with a focus on simplicity and content.

I've once tried [Cargo](https://cargo.site/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). After comparing many frameworks, I decided to build from scratch.

Source codes can be found [here](https://github.com/IvorkChan/Azzar-Next.js).

## About

### Main Dependencies

- `sass`

- `styled-components`

- `react-icons`

- `remark`

- `remark-html`

### Structure

- `/components` contains UI snippets.

- `/lib` contains functional scripts.

- `/pages` contains site pages.

- `/public` contains static resources like fonts and images.

- `/src` contains drafts and posts. I mainly use `.mdx` file.

- `/styles` contains theme modules, I mainly use `.scss` file.

## Design

### 1. Sitemap

I completed the sitemap draft in Notability.

### 2. Styling

> If you're comfortable with React, you should begin by drawing Lo-Fi and adjusting it. There are numerous Pattern Libraries available for reference. I recommend [Mailchimp](https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/color) and [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/developer/pattern-library).

I merely set the global _font_ and _color_, as well as casting the _header_ and _footer_ in this step. Grids, lists, cards, and shadows, amongst other elements, can be enhanced in the future.

One challenge is the navigation between pages, but fortunately the site's structure is simple. Another challenge is responsive design. I've only made simple adjustments for screen width so far.

### 3. Posts

To preserve Markdown compatibility, I merely added basic metadata at the beginning without inserting React components.
