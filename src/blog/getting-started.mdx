# Getting Started with Web

Source codes can be found [here](https://github.com/IvorkChan/Azzar-Next.js).

## About

This website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with a focus on simplicity.

I've once tried [Cargo](https://cargo.site/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). After comparing many frameworks, I decided to build from scratch.

## Design

### 1. Sitemap

I completed the draft in Notability.

### 2. Styling

> If you're comfortable with React, you should begin by drawing Lo-Fi and adjusting it. There are numerous Pattern Libraries available for reference.

I just set the global font and color, as well as casting the header and footer in this step. Grids, lists, cards, and shadows, amongst other elements, can be enhanced in the future.

One challenge is the navigation between pages, however the site's structure is simple. Another challenge is responsive design. I've only made simple adjustments for screen width so far.

### 3. Posts

To preserve Markdown compatibility, I merely added basic metadata at the beginning without inserting React components.
