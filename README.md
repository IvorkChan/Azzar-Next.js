This repo contains a rather stable version of my personal site.

## Main Dependencies

- `sass`

## Structure

- `/components` contains UI snippets.

- `/lib` contains functional scripts.

- `/pages` contains site pages.

- `/public` contains static resources like fonts and images.

- `/src` contains drafts and posts.

- `/styles` contains theme modules.

## Design

Stay simple and focus on content.

`/styles/_vars.scss` states **font and color** globally.

`/styles/layout.module.scss` states style for **header, footer and navigation bar** in every page.
