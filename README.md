# Azzar

**Built with Next.js and Vercel.**

This repo contains a **rather stable** version of my personal site [Azzar](http://ivork.me 'Azzar'). Many expected features are under development.

## Main Dependencies

- `sass` & `styled-components` & `react-icons`

- `remark` & `remark-html`

## Structure

A top-level folder `/src` was created to have all contents needed in 4 main pages (about, portfolio, blog and my collections).

- `/components` contains UI snippets.

- `/lib` contains functional scripts.

- `/pages` contains site pages.

- `/public` contains static resources like fonts and images.

- `/src` contains drafts and posts. I mainly use `.mdx` file.

- `/styles` contains theme modules, I mainly use `.scss` file.

## Design

Stay simple and focus on content.

`/styles/_vars.scss` states **font and color** globally.

`/styles/layout.module.scss` states style for **header and footer** in every page.
